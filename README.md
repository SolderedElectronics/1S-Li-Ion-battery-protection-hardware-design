A battery protector is, simply put, a device that makes sure that something bad doesn't happen to the battery. This small circuit board protects your lithium battery (of any capacity) from overcharge, overdischarge, overcurrent and short circuit. It has a JST connector for connecting the battery, and the battery can be directly soldered.
